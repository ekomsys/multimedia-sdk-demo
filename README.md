# Ekomsys Multimedia SDK Demo

This application can be used as a sample application to evaluate Multimedia SDK and it can be used by developers as a reference while integrating Ekomsys Multimedia SDK in their product.

## Prerequisites

You will need visual studio 2015 and above to compile this application. In case you are just evaluating the [SDK](https://ekomsys.com/downloads/ekomsys-multimedia-sdk-4.0-x64.exe), please download the SDK from website and use the pre built binary MultimediaSDKDemo.


## Getting Started

* Clone the repository on your machine. 
* Download the SDK from ekomsys website - [Ekomsys Multimedia SDK](https://ekomsys.com/downloads/ekomsys-multimedia-sdk-4.0-x64.exe)
* While installing make sure you keep the checkbox to register the COM components.
* Open .sln file in visual studio and compile the project
* Copy the output binary to the bin/x64 directory of SDK and run the binary.


## Running the tests

Demo application provides with the help to run the application. Please follow the prompts in the application to run the demo.


## Deployment

This demo comes with a demo license and cannot be used in production. To deploy this SDK in production you need to get the commercial license from Ekomsys.


## Built With

* [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) - IDE to develop VB.NET applications.
* [Ekomsys Multimedia SDK](http://ekomsys.com) - Required to build and run the application.

## Contributing

### Issues

Specific demo application design and development issues, bugs, and feature requests are maintained by GitHub Issues.

_Please do not post usage, installation, or modeling questions, or other requests for help to Issues._
Use the [forum](http://wiki.ekomsys.com/) instead. This helps developers maintain a clear, uncluttered, and efficient view of the state of demo application.

When reporting a bug, it's most helpful to provide the following information, where applicable:

* What steps reproduce the bug?
* Can you reproduce the bug using the latest master branch?
* What hardware and operating system/distribution are you running?

Try to give your issue a title that is succinct and specific. The devs will rename issues as needed to keep track of them.

### Pull Requests

Ekomsys welcomes all contributions.


Briefly: read commit by commit, a PR should tell a clean, compelling story of _one_ improvement to the application. In particular:

* A PR should do one clear thing that obviously improves application, and nothing more. Making many smaller PRs is better than making one large PR; review effort is superlinear in the amount of code involved.
* Similarly, each commit should be a small, atomic change representing one step in development. PRs should be made of many commits where appropriate.
* Please do rewrite PR history to be clean rather than chronological. Within-PR bugfixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc. should be squashed and should not appear in merged PR history.
* Anything nonobvious from the code should be explained in comments, commit messages, or the PR description, as appropriate.
